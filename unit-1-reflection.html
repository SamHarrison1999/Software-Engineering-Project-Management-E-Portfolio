  <h6>Unit 1 Reflection</h6>
  <p><b>Description</b></p>
  <p>This unit was the first unit of the Software Engineering Project Management module. The goals of this unit were to
    learn about the differences between a project manager and a software engineering project manager and to learn about
    the certifications most project managers attain. These goals were achieved through the lecture cast, required
    reading and collaborative discussion.</p>
  <p><b>Feelings</b></p>
  <p>As I had already done multiple project management modules as part of my undergraduate degree in addition to doing
    online courses on project management and having significant exposure to agile throughout my professional career a
    lot of the content covered was just refreshing stuff I already knew.</p>
  <p>For this unit there was a lot of required reading as for the collaborative discussion there was a 23-page paper in
    addition to the 23-page paper for the assignment and the first 6 chapters from the Applied software project
    management book. I believe this is a tad too much reading for a part time course as I work full time whilst
    studying.</p>
  <p>So far, the collaborative discussions have had very few contributions which is a potential cause for concern as
    part of E-Portfolio requires you to respond to two other posts and at the time of writing only me and one other
    person have made a post making it impossible to comment on two other people. </p>
  <p>I don’t believe that the lecture during this module was very beneficial as it was a very short lecture and a lot of
    the content covered was available on the learning platform so little value was added by attending this lecture. This
    is typically the case with introductory lectures.</p>
  <p>I didn't receive the lecture slides early for the lecture in this unit which I am supposed to receive as part of my
    reasonable adjustment plan.</p>
  <p><b>Evaluation</b></p>
  <p>There wasn’t much if any new content covered in the unit so I didn’t learn much from this unit. However, for
    someone who doesn’t have any prior knowledge I think this could be a useful introduction into project management
    even though there was a high workload for the introductory unit of a module.</p>
  <p><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p>I didn’t learn much in this unit as I had prior knowledge which could make this module easier than the previous
    modules as you’re not learning as much new content.</p>
  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <p>This unit provided me with a background into project management and emphasised the importance of a project manager
    as they can have a significant impact on the overall success of a project.</p>
  <p><b>Action plan</b></p>
  <p>While I don’t see myself working in project management the content covered in this unit did provide me with
    information that could be used in the when planning a project to increase the likelihood of a successful project
    such as ensuring regular communication with stakeholders to avoid miscommunication.</p>
